## Stay Tuned :star: :star: :star: :star: :star: 

v. `1.0` is coming!

* `mklicense` will behave like an old school text-based game, to drive you to which license suits best for your project (thanks [Jerod Santo](https://github.com/jerodsanto) for the idea). But still keeping its value as-is, behaving like a straight-to-the-point tool.


## Why should I use this?

* Licenses are boring;
* Copy/paste stuff is so 1999;
* The GitHub `LICENSE` generator doesn't necessarily includes your information inside the file;
* It's busy people/beginner's friendly. It doesn't have all those flags to just install a license;
* You shouldn't trust other people to store your `LICENSE` sources. `LICENSE`s are sensible.


## Install

```
$ npm install -g mklicense
```


## Usage

```
$ mklicense
```

Since its version 0.1.4, `mklicense` needs `Node` version `>=4` to run properly.


## Licenses included

* Unlicense
* MIT
* Apache 2.0
* MPL 2.0
* GNU LGPL 3.0
* GNU GPL 3.0
* GNU AGPL 3.0


## You talk about trust. So, where are all the licenses located?

`mklicense` extracts licenses from http://choosealicense.com/ (which is [curated by GitHub](http://choosealicense.com/about/)), and creates a `.txt` file for your desired project. I have no control over any license, which is a good thing for you and me.
